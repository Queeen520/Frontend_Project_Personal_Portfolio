        <p id ="text"> <strong>Quentin Jerome Tarantino</strong> (born March 27, 1963 in Knoxville, Tennessee) is an American film director, producer, screenwriter, cinematographer, and actor. He is a two-time Oscar winner, three-time Golden Globe winner and winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. Typical features of his films are numerous allusions and cross-references as well as the use of long dialogues and the explicit depiction of violence. Tarantino dropped out of high school at age 15 and began acting training. Five years later, his extensive knowledge of film detail got him a job at the Video Archives video store in Manhattan Beach. He co-wrote the screenplays My Best Friend's Birthday (1987, the last two acts of the film burned in the editing room after completion) and The Open Road with friends Roger Avary and Jerry Martinez. However, the latter was rejected by all studios because of its length (over 500 pages) and was later divided into True Romance and Natural Born Killers.  Tarantino's film career then began with a deliberate lie: he claimed he had played a role in Godard's film adaptation of King Lear.</p>
